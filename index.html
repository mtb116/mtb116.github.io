                <h3>Morrie T Bradley</h3>
                <p>(she/they)</p>
                <p>I design meaningful and memorable learning material. I specialize in the design, deployment, and maintenance e-learning material for beginner coders. My goals are always to foster motivation and to guide learners to become confident self-teachers. I am a huge proponent of ungrading or "grading for growth" and labor-based grading.</p>
                <p>Prior to instructional design I worked in environmental restoration. I spent the majority of that time in the Pacific Northwest; planting trees, digging up invasives, and getting stung by bees.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I love to draw. I do a considerable amount of freelance work making illustrations for RPGs and storyboarding fantastical and slice-of-life comics.</p>

                <h3>Learning Over Quality: Enabling students to create compelling and authentic portfolio projects.</h3>
                <img src="./assets/project_lrnng_vr_qlty.png">
                <p>Portfolio projects can help faculty identify gaps in curriculum; where student performance does not align with desired outcomes. Additionally, portfolio projects allow students to assess and reflect on their own learning. However, these advantages are lost if beginner level portfolio projects are graded for quality.</p>
                <p>To increase equity and meaningful learning opportunities for students, while still supporting organizational outcomes, this document aims to persuade faculty at coding schools to adopt grading strategies inspired by labor-based grading techniques.</p>
